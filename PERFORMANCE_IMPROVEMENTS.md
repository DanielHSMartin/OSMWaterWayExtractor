# Performance Improvements

## Overview

This version includes significant performance optimizations that address the issue of underutilized processing resources during waterway extraction and processing steps.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Parallel Processing for Core Operations

Added parallel processing using `ThreadPoolExecutor` to the following operations:

- **Step 1: Waterway Coordinate Processing** - Parallel processing for datasets > 1,000 waterways
- **Step 1.5: Geometry Simplification** - Parallel processing for datasets > 500 waterways  
- **Step 2: Endpoint Extraction** - Parallel processing for datasets > 1,000 waterways
- **Step 4: Edge Creation** - Parallel processing for datasets > 100 waterways (main bottleneck)

### 2. Batch Processing Optimizations

- **Distance Calculations**: Optimized batch processing for long coordinate segments (> 20 points)
- **Spatial Clustering**: Chunked processing for large endpoint datasets (> 10,000 points)
- **Spatial Index Queries**: Batch filtering for large candidate sets (> 100 candidates)

### 3. Memory and Cache Locality Improvements

- **Chunked Processing**: Data is split into optimal chunk sizes for better CPU cache utilization
- **Sequential Access Patterns**: Improved memory access patterns in batch operations
- **Reduced Function Call Overhead**: Batch operations reduce per-item function call costs

## Configuration

The parallel processing is controlled by the `parallel_workers` setting in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
processing:
  parallel_workers: 8  # Set to number of CPU cores for optimal performance
```

## Performance Thresholds

The system automatically chooses between sequential and parallel processing based on dataset size:

| Operation | Parallel Threshold | Reason |
|-----------|-------------------|--------|
| Coordinate Processing | 1,000 waterways | Balance overhead vs. benefit |
| Geometry Simplification | 500 waterways | Geometry operations are CPU-intensive |
| Endpoint Extraction | 1,000 waterways | Counter merging requires coordination |
| Edge Creation | 100 waterways | Distance calculations are expensive |

## Expected Performance Gains

- **CPU Utilization**: Should increase from ~10% to 70-90% on multi-core systems
- **Processing Time**: Expected 3-8x speedup on 8-core systems for large datasets
- **Memory Efficiency**: Better cache locality reduces memory bandwidth requirements

## Fallback Behavior

The implementation includes robust error handling:
- If parallel processing fails, automatically falls back to sequential processing
- Individual chunk failures don't affect other chunks
- Original output correctness is preserved

## Monitoring

Use the log output to verify parallel processing is being used:
- Look for "using X parallel workers" messages
- Compare processing times with previous runs
- Monitor CPU utilization during processing

## Compatibility

- All existing configurations remain valid
- Output format and correctness unchanged
- Caching system works with both sequential and parallel modes
- No changes to command-line interface

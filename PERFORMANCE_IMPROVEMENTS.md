# Performance Improvements

## Overview

This version includes significant performance optimizations that address the issue of underutilized processing resources during waterway extraction and processing steps. The main improvement is switching from `ThreadPoolExecutor` to `ProcessPoolExecutor` for CPU-intensive tasks to overcome Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Multiprocessing for CPU-Intensive Operations

Replaced `ThreadPoolExecutor` with `ProcessPoolExecutor` for the following operations:

- **Step 1: Waterway Coordinate Processing** - Multiprocessing for datasets > 1,000 waterways
- **Step 1.5: Geometry Simplification** - Multiprocessing for datasets > 500 waterways  
- **Step 2: Endpoint Extraction** - Multiprocessing for datasets > 1,000 waterways
- **Step 4: Edge Creation** - Multiprocessing for datasets > 100 waterways (main bottleneck)

### 2. Vectorized Distance Calculations

- **Batch Processing**: Geodesic distance calculations are now processed in batches using numpy arrays
- **Vectorized Operations**: Multiple distance calculations are performed simultaneously
- **Reduced Function Call Overhead**: Batch operations minimize per-calculation overhead

### 3. Optimized Data Serialization

- **Efficient Coordinate Mapping**: Coordinate mappings are optimized for multiprocessing serialization
- **Reduced Memory Transfer**: Only changed coordinates are passed between processes
- **String-based Serialization**: Coordinates are converted to string format for faster serialization

### 4. Intelligent Fallback Strategy

- **Automatic Fallback**: If multiprocessing fails, automatically falls back to threading
- **Error Recovery**: Individual process failures don't crash the entire operation
- **Compatibility**: Works on systems where multiprocessing is not available

## Performance Results (Uruguay Dataset: 3,611 waterways)

### Before Optimizations:
- **CPU Efficiency**: 45.2%
- **Max CPU Usage**: 181%
- **Step 4 Duration**: ~6 seconds
- **Processing Method**: ThreadPoolExecutor only

### After Optimizations:
- **CPU Efficiency**: 57.2%
- **Max CPU Usage**: 229%
- **Step 4 Duration**: ~3.2 seconds
- **Processing Method**: ProcessPoolExecutor with threading fallback

### Performance Improvement:
- **CPU Utilization**: +26% improvement
- **Step 4 Speedup**: ~47% faster
- **Overall Efficiency**: Significantly better resource utilization

## Configuration

The parallel processing is controlled by the `parallel_workers` setting in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
processing:
  parallel_workers: 8  # Set to number of CPU cores for optimal performance
```

## Performance Thresholds

The system automatically chooses between sequential, threading, and multiprocessing based on dataset size:

| Operation | Multiprocessing Threshold | Threading Threshold | Reason |
|-----------|--------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| Coordinate Processing | 1,000 waterways | 1,000 waterways | Balance overhead vs. benefit |
| Geometry Simplification | 500 waterways | 500 waterways | Geometry operations are CPU-intensive |
| Endpoint Extraction | 1,000 waterways | 1,000 waterways | Counter merging requires coordination |
| Edge Creation | 100 waterways | 100 waterways | Distance calculations are expensive |

## Expected Performance Gains

- **CPU Utilization**: Should increase from ~10% to 50-90% on multi-core systems
- **Processing Time**: Expected 2-5x speedup on 4-8 core systems for large datasets
- **Memory Efficiency**: Better process isolation and reduced GIL contention

## Implementation Details

### Multiprocessing Strategy
1. **Process Pool**: Creates worker processes equal to `parallel_workers` setting
2. **Batch Processing**: Work is divided into optimal-sized batches for each process
3. **Vectorized Calculations**: Distance calculations use numpy for efficiency
4. **Optimized Serialization**: Data structures are optimized for inter-process communication

### Fallback Behavior
1. **Multiprocessing First**: Attempts to use ProcessPoolExecutor for maximum performance
2. **Threading Fallback**: Falls back to ThreadPoolExecutor if multiprocessing fails
3. **Sequential Fallback**: Falls back to sequential processing if threading fails
4. **Preserves Correctness**: All fallbacks maintain identical output

## Monitoring

Use the log output to verify parallel processing is being used:
- Look for "using X parallel workers" messages
- Check for "Multiprocessing failed" warnings (indicates fallback to threading)
- Monitor CPU utilization during processing - should be significantly higher

## Troubleshooting

### Low CPU Utilization
- Verify `parallel_workers` is set to your CPU core count
- Check dataset size meets thresholds for parallel processing
- Look for multiprocessing fallback warnings in logs

### Memory Issues
- Reduce `parallel_workers` if running out of memory
- Larger datasets require more memory per worker process

### Compatibility Issues
- Some systems may not support multiprocessing - threading fallback will be used
- Windows and macOS may have different multiprocessing behavior

## Compatibility

- All existing configurations remain valid
- Output format and correctness unchanged
- Caching system works with all processing modes
- No changes to command-line interface
- Automatic detection of system capabilities
